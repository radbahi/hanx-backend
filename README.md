# Welcome to HANX!

This is a fan site dedicated to the gifted actor, national treasure, and all around great guy that is Tom Hanks. 

All of the "merch" you see is real (that's right, you really CAN buy a Tom Hanks mini skirt!), but the prices and the ability to buy them here are not.  That section is just for show, and if you attempt to "purchase" anything, you will instead receive a dancing gif of Tom Hanks from the movie "Joe Versus the Volcano" (GREAT FILM).

Enjoy!
